["Managing Motherhood: How ‘Queen Bee’ Managers in the US Service Sector Reduce Motherhood Advantages in Work Scheduling."](http://joshuachoper.github.io/files/managers_vignettes_DISTRIBUTE_Oct2025.pdf) *Social Forces*. Forthcoming.
{% capture details %}
This study advances sociological theories of motherhood-based workplace inequalities by examining how frontline managers shape mothers’ access to stable work schedules in the US service sector. Prior research has shown that mothers in the US service sector experience intense conflict between the time demands of motherhood and employers’ expectations that employees will be available to work unstable work schedules, yet little work has investigated sources of variation in mothers’ exposure to schedule instability. Building on and synthesizing theories of homophily, expectation states theory, and “queen bee” theories of women in management, I propose a model in which managers’ own gender and parenthood status structure their responses to their employees’ scheduling needs. Female managers who are mothers are theorized to exhibit homophily and produce motherhood scheduling advantages, while female managers without children are expected to penalize mothers. Analyses of survey and experimental data collected from a large national sample of US retail and food service workers support this theoretical synthesis, showing that motherhood advantages in scheduling appear under male managers and female managers who are mothers, but erode under female managers without children. By positioning motherhood—not gender alone—as the status dimension that most directly collides with ideal worker norms, this work highlights an important determinant of when women in management act as agents of change and when they reinforce inequality. More broadly, this study frames managerial discretion as a key mechanism linking status expectations, manager- employee relations, and organizational outcomes, advancing theory on the micro-foundations of workplace inequality.

# Current Projects

## The Opportunity Structure for Career Mobility and Inequality

One strand of my research investigates how income and job mobility over the career contribute to economic inequality, with a particular focus on how the structure of jobs in local labor markets shapes inequality in workers' career paths. 

### Working Papers
* ["Black-White Inequality in Earnings Losses After Job Displacement, 1980-2020"](http://joshuachoper.github.io/files/racejobdisplacement_SFRR1_todistribute.pdf) (Revise and Resubmit, *Social Forces*)
{% capture details %}
While social scientists have devoted significant effort to understanding racial economic inequalities, surprisingly little work has examined inequalities in how Black and White workers recover from job loss. Trends in racial inequalities after job loss have not been systematically examined since the mid-1990s, leaving open questions about how economic restructuring and business cycle fluctuations have shaped racial inequalities in post-displacement outcomes. In addition, extant research on racial inequalities in post-displacement outcomes has focused on inequalities among men. I use data from the 1984-2020 Displaced Workers Supplement to the Current Population Survey to offer the first historical accounting of racial inequalities in earnings changes after job displacement since the mid-1990s. Large racial inequalities in earnings losses are explained by Black workers’ relatively low levels of education, employment in vulnerable segments of the labor market, and disadvantage in finding new jobs, but also mitigated by White workers’ large earnings losses due to lost earnings advantages accumulated at their previous job. Among men, racial inequalities in post-displacement earnings increased substantially during the Great Recession, entirely due an increase in differential treatment of similar Black and White men. Using Heckman-corrected models, I demonstrate that standard OLS models substantially underestimate racial inequalities in the effect of job displacement on earnings among men due to racial differences in workers’ likelihood of finding a new job – accounting for racial differences in selection into reemployment reveals significant racial disparities among men in the effect of displacement on earnings between 1980 and 2009.

* ["Stratification After Job Displacement: The Role of Job Tasks, Queueing, and the Declining Demand for Routine Labor"](http://joshuachoper.github.io/files/intro2_displacementtasks.pdf) (Revise and Resubmit, *Socio-Economic Review*)
{% capture details %}
This paper examines inequalities in workers’ ability to recover from job displacement—defined as involuntary job losses due to mass layoffs and plant closures. Millions of US workers are displaced each year and its disruptive effect on workers’ careers is substantial. Still, the sociological understanding of inequalities in the effects of job displacement is underdeveloped. I develop and test a novel framework linking labor market queueing and sorting patterns to post-displacement earnings losses, arguing that inequalities arise from differences in how workers are reabsorbed into the labor market. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) Displaced Workers Supplement (DWS) and Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC), I employ a job-task-based approach to assess changes in earnings after displacement. I demonstrate that mobility into jobs with greater routine and manual task intensity exacerbates earnings losses, while transitions into abstract-task-intensive jobs mitigate them. Non-White and non-college-educated workers experience more severe earnings penalties due to disproportionate sorting into jobs with lower-paying task compositions. Moreover, I show that declining demand for routine labor has intensified inequalities in post-displacement recovery. These findings highlight the role of structural labor market changes in shaping inequalities after job displacement, contributing to broader discussions on labor market stratification.

* "Local Labor Market Polarization and Inequality in Career Earnings Mobility" (available upon request)
{% capture details %}
Occupational polarization, characterized by rising employment and wages at the top of the labor market, declining employment in the middle, and rising employment at the bottom, is a defining feature of change in the US labor market over the last half century. Much work has demonstrated that polarization is an important driver of rising inequality measured in the cross section. However, it is less well understood how polarization shapes inequalities in earnings mobility over workers’ careers. I argue that polarization in local labor markets is an important source of variation in the structure of economic opportunity that workers face as they progress through their careers. Using data from the PSID and US Census and ACS, I demonstrate that in more polarized local labor markets, inequality is somewhat greater when workers begin their careers and workers' earnings trajectories diverge much more dramatically over the life course. I find that the inequality-amplifying effect of polarization operates through a combination of higher returns to education, rapid lifecycle earnings growth among managers and professionals, and high returns to mobility into abstract-cognitive-intensive occupations. Altogether, these dynamics explain a substantial amount of inequality over the life course.

## Inequality in the Low-Wage Labor Market
A second strand of my research examines inequalities in the low-wage labor market. This work considers the individual, organizational, and structural forces driving both the evolution of employment relations in the low-wage labor market and economic inequalities among low-wage workers.

### Working Papers

* "Countervailing Powers: Labor Unions Against the Buyer Power of Walmart Supercenters" (Revise and Resubmit, *American Sociological Review*) (with Lukas Lehner and Zachary Parolin) (available upon request)
{% capture details %}
We expand the sociological study of power struggles in labor markets to consider how the threat of buyer power affects the size and protective strength of worker power. We focus specifically on the interplay of local union membership and the entry of Walmart Supercenters, the archetype of a high-buyer-power employer. We study (1) whether greater worker power dissuades Walmart Supercenters from entering a local labor market, (2) whether a successful Supercenter entry subsequently erodes local union membership, and (3) whether unions provide a protective effect against declining earnings after a successful Supercenter entry. We apply stacked difference-in-difference estimates based on county-year variation in Walmart Supercenter openings using restricted-access Panel Study of Income Dynamics data. We find that Walmart Supercenters are less likely to enter a local labor market that has high levels of union membership, even when conditioning on attempted Walmart entries. When Walmart Supercenter openings do occur, union membership declines by an average of 5 percentage points, and is channeled through declining union membership in retail. Remaining union members are not protected against Walmart’s downward pressure on earnings; in fact, annual earnings among workers who were unionized pre-treatment decline faster than for non-union members after a Walmart Supercenter opens. Worker power can be effective at preventing a rise in buyer power, but conditional on increases in buyer power, worker power tends to decline both in terms of size and protective strength. The sociological study of labor market power ought to consider how prevailing levels of buyer power can moderate the ability of organized labor to achieve its social and economic aims.
