# Current Projects

## The Opportunity Structure for Career Mobility and Inequality

One strand of my research investigates how income and job mobility over the career contribute to economic inequality, with a particular focus on how the structure of jobs in local labor markets shapes inequality in workers' career paths. 

### Working Papers

## Inequality in the Low-Wage Labor Market
A second strand of my research examines inequalities in the low-wage labor market. This work considers the individual, organizational, and structural forces driving both the evolution of employment relations in the low-wage labor market and economic inequalities among low-wage workers.
