Bio
-----
I am a PhD Candidate in Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. I hold Master's Degrees in Sociology (UC Berkeley) and Public Policy (University of Chicago). My research examines how the structure of labor markets, employment relations, and the organization of work within firms shapes inequality and mobility. My work uses panel data methods, causal inference, and survey experiments. 

My dissertation aims to understand how local labor markets structure workers' opportunity for earnings attainment and mobility over their career. I argue that rising inequality between places within the US and declining lifetime earnings mobility are linked, in part by how local differences in the occupational structure create unequal opportunities for workers to realize earnings growth over their career. I find that occupational polarization disproportionately benefits high earners by increasing their early-career earnings while maintaining their advantages in earnings growth. These dynamics benefit workers in managerial and professional occupations and contribute to regional differences in racial and gender inquality. 

A second strand of my research studies the organizational dynamics of work schedule inequality among low-wage workers. I examine how female managers contribute to work scheduling inequalities for their employees who are mothers through the lens of social identity theory, and I investigate how schedule instability increases turnover and in turn contributes to downward earnings mobility.
