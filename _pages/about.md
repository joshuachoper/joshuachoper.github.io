Bio
-----
I am a postdoctoral researcher at Bocconi University. I hold a PhD in Sociology from the University of California Berkeley and a Master's Degree in Public Policy from the University of Chicago. My research examines the labor market processes that produce inequality over workersâ€™ careers. I study how differences in lifecycle patterns of earnings growth, job mobility, and job displacement are structured by firms, local labor markets, and institutions, and how such variation in patterns of intragenerational mobility contributes to macro-level patterns of inequality. Much of this work also advances our understanding of inequalities by race, gender, and class.
